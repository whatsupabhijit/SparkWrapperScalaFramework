# SparkWrapperScalaFramework
Its a generic open source development framework to 
- write your complex business logic in scala but
- wrap it with spark to run your app logic in distributed cluster
- you can use the same business logic to be consumed by both batch or online.
- Use of lazy vals where-ever required so that the framework is more performant.
- Use of Spark SQL is thus limited as the business logic is mainly written in Scala.

At any point of time the branch feature/Integration will be the most updated branch.
 - On each release, the main branch will be updated with the Integration branch.
 - If you wish to move your changes create a branch from the feature/Integration branch and then raise PR from your branch to Integraiton.
